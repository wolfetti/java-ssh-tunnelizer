# Copy this file to a file called application-dev.yml in this folder.
# this file is ignored by git, and you can configure here all the stuff for
# local testing. If you want, you can also insert in this folder a file named
# 'private.key' wich contains your SSH private key. This file is also ignored
# by git. Every parameter is commented with is functions, however this is a 
# very simple application and there is not so much to say :)
